# Generate a list of ten numbers.

previous = 0  # Initializes the var 'previous' = 0 to hold place values
print("Printing current and previous number sum up to 10th number:")

for i in range(10): # begin creating a series of 10 numbers
    current_sum = i + previous  # create current_sum
    print(f"Current Number {i}, Previous Number {previous}, Sum: {current_sum}")
    previous = i
